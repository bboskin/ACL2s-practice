Project ideas for the coming semester (or later on):

1. Contract tutor:
Gives suggestions to
-- explain when a contract needs to be generalized
-- tell when a contract can be refined

2. Property-based program synthesis
-- allow users to put TODO-like blanks in program
-- with either simply a contract to fulfill, or richer properties in mind, 
   have a system to search for possible code fragments 

3. Add higher-order functions to the language -- probably the hardest one of these three.
-- starting out, maybe with restrictions
   (for example, disallow self-application within a lambda body)

4. Related to re-write rules: 
   Add a system to detect non-terminating re-write rules
   Add a system to allow all matching goals to be tests 
   (thinking about the examples on p. 113)
